# Prototype notes

Question: Can a system preserve its observed behavior while its explicitly
tracked computational mechanism is replaced or lost?

Current result: the prototype separates two effects. A structural split keeps
visible and held-out behavior at `1.0` while mechanism continuity falls to
`0.4167`, producing a structure-only Theseus counterexample. A replacement
matches visible probes but fails held-out probes, demonstrating that visible
behavioral equivalence can be a probe-coverage artifact. This is a deterministic
state-machine observation, not evidence about a trained model.

The causal intervention score and component-set overlap are diagnostic signals;
they do not establish mechanistic understanding. This slice now routes the
synthetic checkpoint through `LocalCheckpointAdapter`, binds every state to a
full checkpoint-summary digest, and retains held-out probes, interventions, and
the explicit lineage ledger.

Real local checkpoint result: the pinned GPT-2 bundle loaded successfully from
external custody with all seven artifact digests matching, 160 tensors present,
and checkpoint digest
`bfca28eb087ca25477e3e9b05f1647cb47bbc2f90977a6b54101fabd0c9ca070`. A
layer-0 MLP permutation changed 100% of the selected parameter positions while
preserving top-1 behavior on all visible and held-out prompts; mean relative
logit error was `3.3e-7` visible and `1.2e-7` held out. Ablating the same channel
label after permutation produced cosine similarity `-0.98309803` against the
baseline intervention, while ablating the inverse-mapped channel produced
`0.99999964` cosine similarity.

Insight: channel labels and raw parameter positions are not stable evidence of
causal identity. A function-preserving reparameterization can make a same-label
intervention look unrelated even when the mapped intervention is nearly exact.
This supports a representation-relative version of the Theseus thesis, not a
claim of mechanistic understanding, general model identity, or production
readiness. The next qualification is to repeat this across layers, seeds, and
non-permutation transformations with a predeclared held-out protocol.
